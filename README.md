## Ideas
 - Custom super simple scripting language???
 - Live reload code
 - Single line per thing, like tidalcycles
 - Can get things from network
 - Use [haskell-csound](https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression)
 - Can plug a potentiometer into the jacks?
 - Front panel is just a grid of inputs/outputs. Optionally comes with a small screen.
